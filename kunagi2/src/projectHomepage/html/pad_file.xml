			<Char_Desc_2000> Kunagi is a free  web-based tool for integrated project management and collaboration based on Scrum. It is integrated, allowing users to manage their complete project using only one tool. For that purpose, Scrum is supplemented by a selection of other best practices to cover all project management needs. The tool's range provides not only the basis for all Scrum practices (like product, sprint backlogs and impediment list), but also offers management of additional important project data (like non-functional requirements, risks, files, issues and bugs), as well as several features for ease of use (featuring a project dashboard, an interactive whiteboard for the current sprint and planning poker for estimation) and team collaboration (including comments for every entity, a wiki and a discussion board).  Kunagi is aimed at, but not limited to, software projects. The light nature of agile project management allows for use by both professionals and non-professionals, causing minimal overhead to the project. Therefore, it is also suitable for small projects done by virtual teams, i. e. teams that are scattered across the world.  Using Kunagi's web interface, it is possible to access project related data from anywhere. Despite being an online application, the powerful interface is built to keep up with the flexibility of desktop software, as it makes use of asynchronous technology employing the Google Web Toolkit (GWT).  Last, but not least, it is important to us that the tool helps people get their work done. We understand that it is therefore important for the tool to be not only suitable for project management, but also be accessible, offer a coherent work flow and be fun to use. For this reason, we have been using Kunagi for it's own project management, once it was ready to provide sufficient functionality for our needs. Moreover, after the tool's release, we will provide additions, enhancements and updates on a regular basis. </Char_Desc_2000>
